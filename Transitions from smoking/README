In order to replicate this analysis, the scripts contained in this repository should be followed in numbered order.

Please note that, due to confidentiality reasons, file paths have been omitted. 

In scripts 1-2, the file path "\\path\to\alspac\filestore\..." refers to where the ALSPAC data is stored. This will only be accessible to the ALSPAC team or a direct user. Data used in this project are available on request to the ALSPAC Executive Committee (alspac-exec@bristol.ac.uk) and subject to a data access fee. 

In scripts 1-10, the file path "//path/to/ieu/project/folder/working/data/vaping_transitions/..." refers to where the resulting ALSPAC datasets are stored. During the project these datasets were saved in a secure Research Data Storage Facility, housed and maintained at the University of Bristol.

In scripts 7-10, the file path "C:/path/to/user/outputs/folder/..." refers to the first author's workplace documents folder where analysis outputs, not containing any data, were stored.
